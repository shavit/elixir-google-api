defmodule GoogleApi.CloudIot.V1.Model.DeviceConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  The device configuration. Eventually delivered to devices.

  ## Attributes

  *   `binaryData` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The device configuration data.
  *   `cloudUpdateTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - [Output only] The time at which this configuration version was updated in
      Cloud IoT Core. This timestamp is set by the server.
  *   `deviceAckTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - [Output only] The time at which Cloud IoT Core received the
      acknowledgment from the device, indicating that the device has received
      this configuration version. If this field is not present, the device has
      not yet acknowledged that it received this version. Note that when
      the config was sent to the device, many config versions may have been
      available in Cloud IoT Core while the device was disconnected, and on
      connection, only the latest version is sent to the device. Some
      versions may never be sent to the device, and therefore are never
      acknowledged. This timestamp is set by Cloud IoT Core.
  *   `version` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - [Output only] The version of this update. The version number is assigned by
      the server, and is always greater than 0 after device creation. The
      version must be 0 on the `CreateDevice` request if a `config` is
      specified; the response of `CreateDevice` will always have a value of 1.
