defmodule GoogleApi.Container.V1.Model.SetLocationsRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  SetLocationsRequest sets the locations of the cluster.

  ## Attributes

  *   `clusterId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Deprecated. The name of the cluster to upgrade.
      This field has been deprecated and replaced by the name field.
  *   `locations` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The desired list of Google Compute Engine
      [zones](/compute/docs/zones#available) in which the cluster's nodes
      should be located. Changing the locations a cluster is in will result
      in nodes being either created or removed from the cluster, depending on
      whether locations are being added or removed.

      This list must always include the cluster's primary zone.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name (project, location, cluster) of the cluster to set locations.
      Specified in the format 'projects/*/locations/*/clusters/*'.
  *   `projectId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Deprecated. The Google Developers Console [project ID or project
      number](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158840).
      This field has been deprecated and replaced by the name field.
  *   `zone` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Deprecated. The name of the Google Compute Engine
      [zone](/compute/docs/zones#available) in which the cluster
      resides.
      This field has been deprecated and replaced by the name field.
