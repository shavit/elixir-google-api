  Configuration options for the horizontal pod autoscaling feature, which
  increases or decreases the number of replica pods a replication controller
  has based on the resource usage of the existing pods.

  ## Attributes

  *   `disabled` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether the Horizontal Pod Autoscaling feature is enabled in the cluster.
      When enabled, it ensures that a Heapster pod is running in the cluster,
      which is also used by the Cloud Monitoring service.
