  An action to reset a fully managed device or delete a work profile. Note: blockAction must also be specified.

  ## Attributes

  *   `preserveFrp` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether the factory-reset protection data is preserved on the device. This setting doesnâ€™t apply to work profiles.
  *   `wipeAfterDays` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of days the policy is non-compliant before the device or work profile is wiped. wipeAfterDays must be greater than blockAfterDays.
