defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidManagement.V1.Model.EnrollmentToken do
  @moduledoc """
  An enrollment token.

  ## Attributes

  *   `additionalData` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional, arbitrary data associated with the enrollment token. This could contain, for example, the ID of an org unit the device is assigned to after enrollment. After a device enrolls with the token, this data will be exposed in the enrollment_token_data field of the Device resource. The data must be 1024 characters or less; otherwise, the creation request will fail.
  *   `duration` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The length of time the enrollment token is valid, ranging from 1 minute to 30 days. If not specified, the default duration is 1 hour.
  *   `expirationTimestamp` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The expiration time of the token. This is a read-only field generated by the server.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the enrollment token, which is generated by the server during creation, in the form enterprises/{enterpriseId}/enrollmentTokens/{enrollmentTokenId}.
  *   `oneTimeOnly` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether the enrollment token is for one time use only. If the flag is set to true, only one device can use it for registration.
  *   `policyName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the policy initially applied to the enrolled device, in the form enterprises/{enterpriseId}/policies/{policyId}. If not specified, the policy_name for the device’s user is applied. If user_name is also not specified, enterprises/{enterpriseId}/policies/default is applied by default. When updating this field, you can specify only the policyId as long as the policyId doesn’t contain any slashes. The rest of the policy name will be inferred.
  *   `qrCode` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A JSON string whose UTF-8 representation can be used to generate a QR code to enroll a device with this enrollment token. To enroll a device using NFC, the NFC record must contain a serialized java.util.Properties representation of the properties in the JSON.
  *   `user` (*type:* `GoogleApi.AndroidManagement.V1.Model.User.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The user associated with this enrollment token. If it's specified when the enrollment token is created and the user does not exist, the user will be created. This field must not contain personally identifiable information. Only the account_identifier field needs to be set.
  *   `value` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The token value that's passed to the device and authorizes the device to enroll. This is a read-only field generated by the server.
