defmodule GoogleApi.Monitoring.V3.Model.DroppedLabels do
  @moduledoc """
  A set of (label, value) pairs which were dropped during aggregation, attached to google.api.Distribution.Exemplars in google.api.Distribution values during aggregation.These values are used in combination with the label values that remain on the aggregated Distribution timeseries to construct the full label set for the exemplar values. The resulting full label set may be used to identify the specific task/job/instance (for example) which may be contributing to a long-tail, while allowing the storage savings of only storing aggregated distribution values for a large group.Note that there are no guarantees on ordering of the labels from exemplar-to-exemplar and from distribution-to-distribution in the same stream, and there may be duplicates. It is up to clients to resolve any ambiguities.

  ## Attributes

  *   `label` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - Map from label to its value, for all labels dropped in any aggregation.
