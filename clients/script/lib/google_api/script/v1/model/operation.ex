defmodule GoogleApi.Script.V1.Model.Operation do
  @moduledoc """
  A representation of an execution of an Apps Script function started with run. The execution response does not arrive until the function finishes executing. The maximum execution runtime is listed in the [Apps Script quotas guide](/apps-script/guides/services/quotas#current_limitations). <p>After execution has started, it can have one of four outcomes:</p> <ul> <li> If the script function returns successfully, the
    response field contains an
    ExecutionResponse object
    with the function's return value in the object's `result` field.</li>
  <li> If the script function (or Apps Script itself) throws an exception, the
    error field contains a
    Status object. The `Status` object's `details`
    field contains an array with a single
    ExecutionError object that
    provides information about the nature of the error.</li>
  <li> If the execution has not yet completed,
    the done field is `false` and
    the neither the `response` nor `error` fields are present.</li>
  <li> If the `run` call itself fails (for example, because of a
    malformed request or an authorization error), the method returns an HTTP
    response code in the 4XX range with a different format for the response
    body. Client libraries automatically convert a 4XX response into an
    exception class.</li>
  </ul>

  ## Attributes

  *   `done` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - This field indicates whether the script execution has completed. A completed execution has a populated `response` field containing the ExecutionResponse from function that was executed.
  *   `error` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Script.V1.Model.Status.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If a `run` call succeeds but the script function (or Apps Script itself) throws an exception, this field contains a Status object. The `Status` object's `details` field contains an array with a single ExecutionError object that provides information about the nature of the error.
  *   `response` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - If the script function returns successfully, this field contains an ExecutionResponse object with the function's return value.
