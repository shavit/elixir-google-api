defmodule GoogleApi.CloudResourceManager.V1.Model.ResourceId do
  @moduledoc """
  A container to reference an id for any resource type. A `resource` in Google
  Cloud Platform is a generic term for something you (a developer) may want to
  interact with through one of our API's. Some examples are an App Engine app,
  a Compute Engine instance, a Cloud SQL database, and so on.

  ## Attributes

  *   `id` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required field for the type-specific id. This should correspond to the id
      used in the type-specific API's.
  *   `type` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required field representing the resource type this id is for.
      At present, the valid types are: "organization" and "folder".
