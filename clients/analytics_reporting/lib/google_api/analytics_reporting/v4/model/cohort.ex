defmodule GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.Cohort do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines a cohort. A cohort is a group of users who share a common
  characteristic. For example, all users with the same acquisition date
  belong to the same cohort.

  ## Attributes

  *   `dateRange` (*type:* `GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.DateRange.t`, *default:* `nil`) - This is used for `FIRST_VISIT_DATE` cohort, the cohort selects users
      whose first visit date is between start date and end date defined in the
      DateRange. The date ranges should be aligned for cohort requests. If the
      request contains `ga:cohortNthDay` it should be exactly one day long,
      if `ga:cohortNthWeek` it should be aligned to the week boundary (starting
      at Sunday and ending Saturday), and for `ga:cohortNthMonth` the date range
      should be aligned to the month (starting at the first and ending on the
      last day of the month).
      For LTV requests there are no such restrictions.
      You do not need to supply a date range for the
      `reportsRequest.dateRanges` field.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A unique name for the cohort. If not defined name will be auto-generated
      with values cohort_[1234...].
  *   `type` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Type of the cohort. The only supported type as of now is
      `FIRST_VISIT_DATE`. If this field is unspecified the cohort is treated
      as `FIRST_VISIT_DATE` type cohort.
