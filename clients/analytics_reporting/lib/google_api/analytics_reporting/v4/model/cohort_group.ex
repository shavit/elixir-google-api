defmodule GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.CohortGroup do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines a cohort group.
  For example:

      "cohortGroup": {
        "cohorts": [{
          "name": "cohort 1",
          "type": "FIRST_VISIT_DATE",
          "dateRange": { "startDate": "2015-08-01", "endDate": "2015-08-01" }
        },{
          "name": "cohort 2"
           "type": "FIRST_VISIT_DATE"
           "dateRange": { "startDate": "2015-07-01", "endDate": "2015-07-01" }
        }]
      }

  ## Attributes

  *   `cohorts` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.Cohort.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The definition for the cohort.
  *   `lifetimeValue` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Enable Life Time Value (LTV).  LTV measures lifetime value for users
      acquired through different channels.
      Please see:
      [Cohort Analysis](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6074676) and
      [Lifetime Value](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6182550)
      If the value of lifetimeValue is false:

      - The metric values are similar to the values in the web interface cohort
        report.
      - The cohort definition date ranges must be aligned to the calendar week
        and month. i.e. while requesting `ga:cohortNthWeek` the `startDate` in
        the cohort definition should be a Sunday and the `endDate` should be the
        following Saturday, and for `ga:cohortNthMonth`, the `startDate`
        should be the 1st of the month and `endDate` should be the last day
        of the month.

      When the lifetimeValue is true:

      - The metric values will correspond to the values in the web interface
        LifeTime value report.
      - The Lifetime Value report shows you how user value (Revenue) and
        engagement (Appviews, Goal Completions, Sessions, and Session Duration)
        grow during the 90 days after a user is acquired.
      - The metrics are calculated as a cumulative average per user per the time
        increment.
      - The cohort definition date ranges need not be aligned to the calendar
        week and month boundaries.
      - The `viewId` must be an
        [app view
        ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2649553#WebVersusAppViews)
