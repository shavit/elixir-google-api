defmodule GoogleApi.Jobs.V2.Model.RequestMetadata do
  @moduledoc """
  Input only.

  Meta information related to the job searcher or entity
  conducting the job search. This information is used to improve the
  performance of the service.

  ## Attributes

  *   `deviceInfo` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Jobs.V2.Model.DeviceInfo.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. The type of device used by the job seeker at the time of the call to the
      service.
  *   `domain` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The client-defined scope or source of the service call, which typically
      is the domain on
      which the service has been implemented and is currently being run.

      For example, if the service is being run by client <em>Foo, Inc.</em>, on
      job board www.foo.com and career site www.bar.com, then this field is
      set to "foo.com" for use on the job board, and "bar.com" for use on the
      career site.

      If this field is not available for some reason, send "UNKNOWN". Note that
      any improvements to the service model for a particular tenant site rely on
      this field being set correctly to some domain.
  *   `sessionId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. A unique session identification string. A session is defined as the
      duration of an end user's interaction with the service over a period.
      Obfuscate this field for privacy concerns before
      providing it to the API.

      If this field is not available for some reason, please send "UNKNOWN". Note
      that any improvements to the service model for a particular tenant site,
      rely on this field being set correctly to some unique session_id.
  *   `userId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. A unique user identification string, as determined by the client. The
      client is responsible for ensuring client-level uniqueness of this value
      in order to have the strongest positive impact on search quality.
      Obfuscate this field for privacy concerns before
      providing it to the service.

      If this field is not available for some reason, please send "UNKNOWN". Note
      that any improvements to the service model for a particular tenant site,
      rely on this field being set correctly to some unique user_id.
