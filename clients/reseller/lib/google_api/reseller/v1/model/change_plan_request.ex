  JSON template for the ChangePlan rpc request.

  ## Attributes

  *   `dealCode` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Google-issued code (100 char max) for discounted pricing on subscription plans. Deal code must be included in changePlan request in order to receive discounted rate. This property is optional. If a deal code has already been added to a subscription, this property may be left empty and the existing discounted rate will still apply (if not empty, only provide the deal code that is already present on the subscription). If a deal code has never been added to a subscription and this property is left blank, regular pricing will apply.
  *   `kind` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `subscriptions#changePlanRequest`) - Identifies the resource as a subscription change plan request. Value: subscriptions#changePlanRequest
  *   `planName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The planName property is required. This is the name of the subscription's payment plan. For more information about the Google payment plans, see API concepts.

      Possible values are:  
      - ANNUAL_MONTHLY_PAY - The annual commitment plan with monthly payments  Caution: ANNUAL_MONTHLY_PAY is returned as ANNUAL in all API responses.  
      - ANNUAL_YEARLY_PAY - The annual commitment plan with yearly payments  
      - FLEXIBLE - The flexible plan  
      - TRIAL - The 30-day free trial plan
  *   `purchaseOrderId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - This is an optional property. This purchase order (PO) information is for resellers to use for their company tracking usage. If a purchaseOrderId value is given it appears in the API responses and shows up in the invoice. The property accepts up to 80 plain text characters.
  *   `seats` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Reseller.V1.Model.Seats.t`, *default:* `nil`) - This is a required property. The seats property is the number of user seat licenses.
