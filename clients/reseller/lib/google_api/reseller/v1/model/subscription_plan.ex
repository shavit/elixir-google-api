  The plan property is required. In this version of the API, the G Suite plans are the flexible plan, annual commitment plan, and the 30-day free trial plan. For more information about the API"s payment plans, see the API concepts.

  ## Attributes

  *   `commitmentInterval` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Reseller.V1.Model.SubscriptionPlanCommitmentInterval.t`, *default:* `nil`) - In this version of the API, annual commitment plan's interval is one year.  Note: When billingMethod value is OFFLINE, the subscription property object plan.commitmentInterval is omitted in all API responses.
  *   `isCommitmentPlan` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - The isCommitmentPlan property's boolean value identifies the plan as an annual commitment plan:
      - true — The subscription's plan is an annual commitment plan.
      - false — The plan is not an annual commitment plan.
  *   `planName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The planName property is required. This is the name of the subscription's plan. For more information about the Google payment plans, see the API concepts.

      Possible values are:  
      - ANNUAL_MONTHLY_PAY — The annual commitment plan with monthly payments.  Caution: ANNUAL_MONTHLY_PAY is returned as ANNUAL in all API responses.  
      - ANNUAL_YEARLY_PAY — The annual commitment plan with yearly payments  
      - FLEXIBLE — The flexible plan  
      - TRIAL — The 30-day free trial plan. A subscription in trial will be suspended after the 30th free day if no payment plan is assigned. Calling changePlan will assign a payment plan to a trial but will not activate the plan. A trial will automatically begin its assigned payment plan after its 30th free day or immediately after calling startPaidService.  
      - FREE — The free plan is exclusive to the Cloud Identity SKU and does not incur any billing.
