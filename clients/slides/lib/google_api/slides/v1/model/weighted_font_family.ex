defmodule GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.WeightedFontFamily do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a font family and weight used to style a TextRun.

  ## Attributes

  *   `fontFamily` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The font family of the text.

      The font family can be any font from the Font menu in Slides or from
      [Google Fonts] (https://fonts.google.com/). If the font name is
      unrecognized, the text is rendered in `Arial`.
  *   `weight` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The rendered weight of the text. This field can have any value that is a
      multiple of `100` between `100` and `900`, inclusive. This range
      corresponds to the numerical values described in the CSS 2.1
      Specification,
      [section 15.6](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/fonts.html#font-boldness),
      with non-numerical values disallowed. Weights greater than or equal to
      `700` are considered bold, and weights less than `700`are not bold. The
      default value is `400` ("normal").
