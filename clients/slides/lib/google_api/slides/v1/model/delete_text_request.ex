defmodule GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.DeleteTextRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Deletes text from a shape or a table cell.

  ## Attributes

  *   `cellLocation` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.TableCellLocation.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The optional table cell location if the text is to be deleted from a table
      cell. If present, the object_id must refer to a table.
  *   `objectId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The object ID of the shape or table from which the text will be deleted.
  *   `textRange` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.Range.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The range of text to delete, based on TextElement indexes.

      There is always an implicit newline character at the end of a shape's or
      table cell's text that cannot be deleted. `Range.Type.ALL` will use the
      correct bounds, but care must be taken when specifying explicit bounds for
      range types `FROM_START_INDEX` and `FIXED_RANGE`. For example, if the text
      is "ABC", followed by an implicit newline, then the maximum value is 2 for
      `text_range.start_index` and 3 for `text_range.end_index`.

      Deleting text that crosses a paragraph boundary may result in changes
      to paragraph styles and lists as the two paragraphs are merged.

      Ranges that include only one code unit of a surrogate pair are expanded to
      include both code units.
