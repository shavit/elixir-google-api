  The properties of Page that are only
  relevant for pages with page_type SLIDE.

  ## Attributes

  *   `layoutObjectId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The object ID of the layout that this slide is based on. This property is
      read-only.
  *   `masterObjectId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The object ID of the master that this slide is based on. This property is
      read-only.
  *   `notesPage` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.Page.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The notes page that this slide is associated with. It defines the visual
      appearance of a notes page when printing or exporting slides with speaker
      notes. A notes page inherits properties from the
      notes master.
      The placeholder shape with type BODY on the notes page contains the speaker
      notes for this slide. The ID of this shape is identified by the
      speakerNotesObjectId field.
      The notes page is read-only except for the text content and styles of the
      speaker notes shape. This property is read-only.
