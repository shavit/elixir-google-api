  The message returned to the client by the `SynthesizeSpeech` method.

  ## Attributes

  *   `audioContent` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The audio data bytes encoded as specified in the request, including the
      header for encodings that are wrapped in containers (e.g. MP3, OGG_OPUS).
      For LINEAR16 audio, we include the WAV header. Note: as
      with all bytes fields, protobuffers use a pure binary representation,
      whereas JSON representations use base64.
