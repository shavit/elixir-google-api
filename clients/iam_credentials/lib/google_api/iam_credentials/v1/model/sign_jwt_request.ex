  ## Attributes

  *   `delegates` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The sequence of service accounts in a delegation chain. Each service
      account must be granted the `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role
      on its next service account in the chain. The last service account in the
      chain must be granted the `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role
      on the service account that is specified in the `name` field of the
      request.

      The delegates must have the following format:
      `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT_EMAIL_OR_UNIQUEID}`. The `-` wildcard
      character is required; replacing it with a project ID is invalid.
  *   `payload` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The JWT payload to sign: a JSON object that contains a JWT Claims Set.
