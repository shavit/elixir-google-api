defmodule GoogleApi.CloudBuild.V1.Model.Artifacts do
  @moduledoc """
  Artifacts produced by a build that should be uploaded upon
  successful completion of all build steps.

  ## Attributes

  *   `images` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of images to be pushed upon the successful completion of all build
      steps.

      The images will be pushed using the builder service account's credentials.

      The digests of the pushed images will be stored in the Build resource's
      results field.

      If any of the images fail to be pushed, the build is marked FAILURE.
  *   `objects` (*type:* `GoogleApi.CloudBuild.V1.Model.ArtifactObjects.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of objects to be uploaded to Cloud Storage upon successful
      completion of all build steps.

      Files in the workspace matching specified paths globs will be uploaded to
      the specified Cloud Storage location using the builder service account's
      credentials.

      The location and generation of the uploaded objects will be stored in the
      Build resource's results field.

      If any objects fail to be pushed, the build is marked FAILURE.
