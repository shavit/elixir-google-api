defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceConsumerManagement.V1.Model.V1Beta1QuotaOverride do

  A quota override

  ## Attributes

  *   `dimensions` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - If this map is nonempty, then this override applies only to specific values
      for dimensions defined in the limit unit.

      For example, an override on a limit with the unit 1/{project}/{region}
      could contain an entry with the key "region" and the value "us-east-1";
      the override is only applied to quota consumed in that region.

      This map has the following restrictions:
      - Keys that are not defined in the limit's unit are not valid keys.
        Any string appearing in {brackets} in the unit (besides {project} or
        {user}) is a defined key.
      - "project" is not a valid key; the project is already specified in
        the parent resource name.
      - "user" is not a valid key; the API does not support quota overrides
        that apply only to a specific user.
      - If "region" appears as a key, its value must be a valid Cloud region.
      - If "zone" appears as a key, its value must be a valid Cloud zone.
      - If any valid key other than "region" or "zone" appears in the map, then
        all valid keys other than "region" or "zone" must also appear in the map.
  *   `metric` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the metric to which this override applies.

      An example name would be:
      `compute.googleapis.com/cpus`
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The resource name of the producer override.
      An example name would be:
      `services/compute.googleapis.com/projects/123/consumerQuotaMetrics/compute.googleapis.com%2Fcpus/limits/%2Fproject%2Fregion/producerOverrides/4a3f2c1d`
  *   `overrideValue` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The overriding quota limit value.
      Can be any nonnegative integer, or -1 (unlimited quota).
  *   `unit` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The limit unit of the limit to which this override applies.

      An example unit would be:
      `1/{project}/{region}`
      Note that `{project}` and `{region}` are not placeholders in this example;
      the literal characters `{` and `}` occur in the string.
