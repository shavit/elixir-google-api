defmodule GoogleApi.ReplicaPool.V1beta1.Model.Action do
  @moduledoc """
  An action that gets executed during initialization of the replicas.

  ## Attributes

  *   `commands` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of commands to run, one per line. If any command fails, the whole action is considered a failure and no further actions are run. This also marks the virtual machine or replica as a failure.
  *   `envVariables` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.ReplicaPool.V1beta1.Model.EnvVariable.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of environment variables to use for the commands in this action.
  *   `timeoutMilliSeconds` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - If an action's commands on a particular replica do not finish in the specified timeoutMilliSeconds, the replica is considered to be in a FAILING state. No efforts are made to stop any processes that were spawned or created as the result of running the action's commands. The default is the max allowed value, 1 hour (i.e. 3600000 milliseconds).
