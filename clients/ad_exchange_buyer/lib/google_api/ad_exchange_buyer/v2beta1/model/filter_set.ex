defmodule GoogleApi.AdExchangeBuyer.V2beta1.Model.FilterSet do
  @moduledoc """
  A set of filters that is applied to a request for data.
  Within a filter set, an AND operation is performed across the filters
  represented by each field. An OR operation is performed across the filters
  represented by the multiple values of a repeated field, e.g.,
  "format=VIDEO AND deal_id=12 AND (seller_network_id=34 OR
  seller_network_id=56)".

  ## Attributes

  *   `absoluteDateRange` (*type:* `GoogleApi.AdExchangeBuyer.V2beta1.Model.AbsoluteDateRange.t`, *default:* `nil`) - An absolute date range, defined by a start date and an end date.
      Interpreted relative to Pacific time zone.
  *   `breakdownDimensions` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The set of dimensions along which to break down the response; may be empty.
      If multiple dimensions are requested, the breakdown is along the Cartesian
      product of the requested dimensions.
  *   `creativeId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The ID of the creative on which to filter; optional. This field may be set
      only for a filter set that accesses account-level troubleshooting data,
      i.e., one whose name matches the `bidders/*/accounts/*/filterSets/*`
      pattern.
  *   `dealId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The ID of the deal on which to filter; optional. This field may be set
      only for a filter set that accesses account-level troubleshooting data,
      i.e., one whose name matches the `bidders/*/accounts/*/filterSets/*`
      pattern.
  *   `environment` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The environment on which to filter; optional.
  *   `formats` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The list of formats on which to filter; may be empty. The filters
      represented by multiple formats are ORed together (i.e., if non-empty,
      results must match any one of the formats).
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A user-defined name of the filter set. Filter set names must be unique
      globally and match one of the patterns:

      - `bidders/*/filterSets/*` (for accessing bidder-level troubleshooting
      data)
      - `bidders/*/accounts/*/filterSets/*` (for accessing account-level
      troubleshooting data)

      This field is required in create operations.
  *   `platforms` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The list of platforms on which to filter; may be empty. The filters
      represented by multiple platforms are ORed together (i.e., if non-empty,
      results must match any one of the platforms).
  *   `publisherIdentifiers` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - For Open Bidding partners only.
      The list of publisher identifiers on which to filter; may be empty.
      The filters represented by multiple publisher identifiers are ORed
      together.
  *   `realtimeTimeRange` (*type:* `GoogleApi.AdExchangeBuyer.V2beta1.Model.RealtimeTimeRange.t`, *default:* `nil`) - An open-ended realtime time range, defined by the aggregation start
      timestamp.
  *   `relativeDateRange` (*type:* `GoogleApi.AdExchangeBuyer.V2beta1.Model.RelativeDateRange.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A relative date range, defined by an offset from today and a duration.
      Interpreted relative to Pacific time zone.
  *   `sellerNetworkIds` (*type:* `list(integer())`, *default:* `nil`) - For Authorized Buyers only.
      The list of IDs of the seller (publisher) networks on which to filter;
      may be empty. The filters represented by multiple seller network IDs are
      ORed together (i.e., if non-empty, results must match any one of the
      publisher networks). See
      [seller-network-ids](https://developers.google.com/authorized-buyers/rtb/downloads/seller-network-ids)
      file for the set of existing seller network IDs.
  *   `timeSeriesGranularity` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The granularity of time intervals if a time series breakdown is desired;
      optional.
