defmodule GoogleApi.DLP.V2.Model.GooglePrivacyDlpV2SurrogateType do
  @moduledoc """
  Message for detecting output from deidentification transformations
  such as
  [`CryptoReplaceFfxFpeConfig`](/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/organizations.deidentifyTemplates#cryptoreplaceffxfpeconfig).
  These types of transformations are
  those that perform pseudonymization, thereby producing a "surrogate" as
  output. This should be used in conjunction with a field on the
  transformation such as `surrogate_info_type`. This CustomInfoType does
  not support the use of `detection_rules`.
