  @moduledoc """
  A (kind, ID/name) pair used to construct a key path.

  If either name or ID is set, the element is complete.
  If neither is set, the element is incomplete.

  ## Attributes

  *   `id` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The auto-allocated ID of the entity.
      Never equal to zero. Values less than zero are discouraged and may not
      be supported in the future.
  *   `kind` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The kind of the entity.
      A kind matching regex `__.*__` is reserved/read-only.
      A kind must not contain more than 1500 bytes when UTF-8 encoded.
      Cannot be `""`.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the entity.
      A name matching regex `__.*__` is reserved/read-only.
      A name must not be more than 1500 bytes when UTF-8 encoded.
      Cannot be `""`.
