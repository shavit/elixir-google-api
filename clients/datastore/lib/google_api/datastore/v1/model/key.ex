defmodule GoogleApi.Datastore.V1.Model.Key do
  @moduledoc """
  A unique identifier for an entity.
  If a key's partition ID or any of its path kinds or names are
  reserved/read-only, the key is reserved/read-only.
  A reserved/read-only key is forbidden in certain documented contexts.

  ## Attributes

  *   `partitionId` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Datastore.V1.Model.PartitionId.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Entities are partitioned into subsets, currently identified by a project
      ID and namespace ID.
      Queries are scoped to a single partition.
  *   `path` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Datastore.V1.Model.PathElement.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The entity path.
      An entity path consists of one or more elements composed of a kind and a
      string or numerical identifier, which identify entities. The first
      element identifies a _root entity_, the second element identifies
      a _child_ of the root entity, the third element identifies a child of the
      second entity, and so forth. The entities identified by all prefixes of
      the path are called the element's _ancestors_.

      An entity path is always fully complete: *all* of the entity's ancestors
      are required to be in the path along with the entity identifier itself.
      The only exception is that in some documented cases, the identifier in the
      last path element (for the entity) itself may be omitted. For example,
      the last path element of the key of `Mutation.insert` may have no
      identifier.

      A path can never be empty, and a path can have at most 100 elements.
