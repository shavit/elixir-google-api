defmodule GoogleApi.Logging.V2.Model.BigQueryOptions do
  @moduledoc """
  Options that change functionality of a sink exporting data to BigQuery.

  ## Attributes

  *   `usePartitionedTables` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables. By default, Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax has to be used instead. In both cases, tables are sharded based on UTC timezone.
