defmodule GoogleApi.Vision.V1.Model.ProductSearchParams do
  @moduledoc """
  Parameters for a product search request.

  ## Attributes

  *   `boundingPoly` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Vision.V1.Model.BoundingPoly.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The bounding polygon around the area of interest in the image.
      Optional. If it is not specified, system discretion will be applied.
  *   `filter` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The filtering expression. This can be used to restrict search results based
      on Product labels. We currently support an AND of OR of key-value
      expressions, where each expression within an OR must have the same key. An
      '=' should be used to connect the key and value.

      For example, "(color = red OR color = blue) AND brand = Google" is
      acceptable, but "(color = red OR brand = Google)" is not acceptable.
      "color: red" is not acceptable because it uses a ':' instead of an '='.
  *   `productCategories` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The list of product categories to search in. Currently, we only consider
      the first category, and either "homegoods-v2", "apparel-v2", "toys-v2",
      "packagedgoods-v1", or "general-v1" should be specified. The legacy
      categories "homegoods", "apparel", and "toys" are still supported but will
      be deprecated. For new products, please use "homegoods-v2", "apparel-v2",
      or "toys-v2" for better product search accuracy. It is recommended to
      migrate existing products to these categories as well.
  *   `productSet` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The resource name of a ProductSet to be searched for similar images.

      Format is:
      `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/productSets/PRODUCT_SET_ID`.
