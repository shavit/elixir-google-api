# GoogleApi.CloudTrace

Stackdriver Trace API client library.

Sends application trace data to Stackdriver Trace for viewing. Trace data is collected for all App Engine applications by default. Trace data from other applications can be provided using this API. This library is used to interact with the Trace API directly. If you are looking to instrument your application for Stackdriver Trace, we recommend using OpenCensus.
