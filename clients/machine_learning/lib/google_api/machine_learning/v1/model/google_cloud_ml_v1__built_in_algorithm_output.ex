defmodule GoogleApi.MachineLearning.V1.Model.GoogleCloudMlV1_BuiltInAlgorithmOutput do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents output related to a built-in algorithm Job.

  ## Attributes

  *   `framework` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Framework on which the built-in algorithm was trained.
  *   `modelPath` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The Cloud Storage path to the `model/` directory where the training job
      saves the trained model. Only set for successful jobs that don't use
      hyperparameter tuning.
  *   `pythonVersion` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Python version on which the built-in algorithm was trained.
  *   `runtimeVersion` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - AI Platform runtime version on which the built-in algorithm was
      trained.
