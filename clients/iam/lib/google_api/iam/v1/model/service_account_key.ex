defmodule GoogleApi.IAM.V1.Model.ServiceAccountKey do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a service account key.

  A service account has two sets of key-pairs: user-managed, and
  system-managed.

  User-managed key-pairs can be created and deleted by users.  Users are
  responsible for rotating these keys periodically to ensure security of
  their service accounts.  Users retain the private key of these key-pairs,
  and Google retains ONLY the public key.

  System-managed keys are automatically rotated by Google, and are used for
  signing for a maximum of two weeks. The rotation process is probabilistic,
  and usage of the new key will gradually ramp up and down over the key's
  lifetime. We recommend caching the public key set for a service account for
  no more than 24 hours to ensure you have access to the latest keys.

  Public keys for all service accounts are also published at the OAuth2
  Service Account API.

  ## Attributes

  *   `keyAlgorithm` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Specifies the algorithm (and possibly key size) for the key.
  *   `keyOrigin` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The key origin.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The resource name of the service account key in the following format
      `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}/keys/{key}`.
  *   `privateKeyData` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The private key data. Only provided in `CreateServiceAccountKey`
      responses. Make sure to keep the private key data secure because it
      allows for the assertion of the service account identity.
      When base64 decoded, the private key data can be used to authenticate with
      Google API client libraries and with
      <a href="/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/activate-service-account">gcloud
      auth activate-service-account</a>.
  *   `privateKeyType` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The output format for the private key.
      Only provided in `CreateServiceAccountKey` responses, not
      in `GetServiceAccountKey` or `ListServiceAccountKey` responses.

      Google never exposes system-managed private keys, and never retains
      user-managed private keys.
  *   `publicKeyData` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The public key data. Only provided in `GetServiceAccountKey` responses.
  *   `validAfterTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The key can be used after this timestamp.
  *   `validBeforeTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The key can be used before this timestamp.
      For system-managed key pairs, this timestamp is the end time for the
      private key signing operation. The public key could still be used
      for verification for a few hours after this time.
