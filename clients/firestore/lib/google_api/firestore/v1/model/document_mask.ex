defmodule GoogleApi.Firestore.V1.Model.DocumentMask do
  @moduledoc """
  A set of field paths on a document.
  Used to restrict a get or update operation on a document to a subset of its
  fields.
  This is different from standard field masks, as this is always scoped to a
  Document, and takes in account the dynamic nature of Value.

  ## Attributes

  *   `fieldPaths` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The list of field paths in the mask. See Document.fields for a field
      path syntax reference.
