defmodule GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.KeySet do
  @moduledoc """
  `KeySet` defines a collection of Cloud Spanner keys and/or key ranges. All
  the keys are expected to be in the same table or index. The keys need
  not be sorted in any particular way.

  If the same key is specified multiple times in the set (for example
  if two ranges, two keys, or a key and a range overlap), Cloud Spanner
  behaves as if the key were only specified once.

  ## Attributes

  *   `all` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - For convenience `all` can be set to `true` to indicate that this
      `KeySet` matches all keys in the table or index. Note that any keys
      specified in `keys` or `ranges` are only yielded once.
  *   `keys` (*type:* `list(list(any()))`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of specific keys. Entries in `keys` should have exactly as
      many elements as there are columns in the primary or index key
      with which this `KeySet` is used.  Individual key values are
      encoded as described here.
  *   `ranges` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.KeyRange.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of key ranges. See KeyRange for more information about
      key range specifications.
