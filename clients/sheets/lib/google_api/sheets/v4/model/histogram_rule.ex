defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.HistogramRule do
  @moduledoc """
  Allows you to organize the numeric values in a source data column into
  buckets of a constant size. All values from HistogramRule.start to
  HistogramRule.end are placed into groups of size
  HistogramRule.interval. In addition, all values below
  HistogramRule.start are placed in one group, and all values above
  HistogramRule.end are placed in another. Only
  HistogramRule.interval is required, though if HistogramRule.start
  and HistogramRule.end are both provided, HistogramRule.start must
  be less than HistogramRule.end. For example, a pivot table showing
  average purchase amount by age that has 50+ rows:

      +-----+-------------------+
      | Age | AVERAGE of Amount |
      +-----+-------------------+
      | 16  |            $27.13 |
      | 17  |             $5.24 |
      | 18  |            $20.15 |
      ...
      +-----+-------------------+
  could be turned into a pivot table that looks like the one below by
  applying a histogram group rule with a HistogramRule.start of 25,
  an HistogramRule.interval of 20, and an HistogramRule.end
  of 65.

      +-------------+-------------------+
      | Grouped Age | AVERAGE of Amount |
      +-------------+-------------------+
      | < 25        |            $19.34 |
      | 25-45       |            $31.43 |
      | 45-65       |            $35.87 |
      | > 65        |            $27.55 |
      +-------------+-------------------+
      | Grand Total |            $29.12 |
      +-------------+-------------------+

  ## Attributes

  *   `end` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The maximum value at which items are placed into buckets
      of constant size. Values above end are lumped into a single bucket.
      This field is optional.
  *   `interval` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The size of the buckets that are created. Must be positive.
  *   `start` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The minimum value at which items are placed into buckets
      of constant size. Values below start are lumped into a single bucket.
      This field is optional.
