defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.ClearValuesResponse do

  The response when clearing a range of values in a spreadsheet.

  ## Attributes

  *   `clearedRange` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The range (in A1 notation) that was cleared.
      (If the request was for an unbounded range or a ranger larger
       than the bounds of the sheet, this will be the actual range
       that was cleared, bounded to the sheet's limits.)
  *   `spreadsheetId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The spreadsheet the updates were applied to.
