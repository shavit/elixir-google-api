defmodule GoogleApi.YouTube.V3.Model.VideoFileDetails do
  @moduledoc """
  Describes original video file properties, including technical details about audio and video streams, but also metadata information like content length, digitization time, or geotagging information.

  ## Attributes

  *   `audioStreams` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.YouTube.V3.Model.VideoFileDetailsAudioStream.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of audio streams contained in the uploaded video file. Each item in the list contains detailed metadata about an audio stream.
  *   `bitrateBps` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The uploaded video file's combined (video and audio) bitrate in bits per second.
  *   `container` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The uploaded video file's container format.
  *   `creationTime` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The date and time when the uploaded video file was created. The value is specified in ISO 8601 format. Currently, the following ISO 8601 formats are supported:  
      - Date only: YYYY-MM-DD 
      - Naive time: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS 
      - Time with timezone: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM
  *   `durationMs` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The length of the uploaded video in milliseconds.
  *   `fileName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The uploaded file's name. This field is present whether a video file or another type of file was uploaded.
  *   `fileSize` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The uploaded file's size in bytes. This field is present whether a video file or another type of file was uploaded.
  *   `fileType` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The uploaded file's type as detected by YouTube's video processing engine. Currently, YouTube only processes video files, but this field is present whether a video file or another type of file was uploaded.
  *   `videoStreams` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.YouTube.V3.Model.VideoFileDetailsVideoStream.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of video streams contained in the uploaded video file. Each item in the list contains detailed metadata about a video stream.
