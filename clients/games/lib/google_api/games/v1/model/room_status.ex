  ## Attributes

  *   `autoMatchingStatus` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Games.V1.Model.RoomAutoMatchStatus.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Auto-matching status for this room. Not set if the room is not currently in the automatching queue.
  *   `kind` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `games#roomStatus`) - Uniquely identifies the type of this resource. Value is always the fixed string games#roomStatus.
  *   `participants` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Games.V1.Model.RoomParticipant.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The participants involved in the room, along with their statuses. Includes participants who have left or declined invitations.
  *   `roomId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Globally unique ID for a room.
  *   `status` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The status of the room.
