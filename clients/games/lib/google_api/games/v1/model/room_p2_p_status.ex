defmodule GoogleApi.Games.V1.Model.RoomP2PStatus do
  @moduledoc """
  This is a JSON template for an update on the status of a peer in a room.

  ## Attributes

  *   `connectionSetupLatencyMillis` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The amount of time in milliseconds it took to establish connections with this peer.
  *   `error` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The error code in event of a failure.
      Possible values are:  
      - "P2P_FAILED" - The client failed to establish a P2P connection with the peer. 
      - "PRESENCE_FAILED" - The client failed to register to receive P2P connections. 
      - "RELAY_SERVER_FAILED" - The client received an error when trying to use the relay server to establish a P2P connection with the peer.
  *   `error_reason` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - More detailed diagnostic message returned in event of a failure.
  *   `kind` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `games#roomP2PStatus`) - Uniquely identifies the type of this resource. Value is always the fixed string games#roomP2PStatus.
  *   `participantId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The ID of the participant.
  *   `status` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The status of the peer in the room.
      Possible values are:  
      - "CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED" - The client established a P2P connection with the peer. 
      - "CONNECTION_FAILED" - The client failed to establish directed presence with the peer.
  *   `unreliableRoundtripLatencyMillis` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The amount of time in milliseconds it took to send packets back and forth on the unreliable channel with this peer.
