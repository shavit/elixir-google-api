  Student work for an assignment.

  ## Attributes

  *   `attachments` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Classroom.V1.Model.Attachment.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Attachments added by the student.
      Drive files that correspond to materials with a share mode of
      STUDENT_COPY may not exist yet if the student has not accessed the
      assignment in Classroom.

      Some attachment metadata is only populated if the requesting user has
      permission to access it. Identifier and alternate_link fields are always
      available, but others (e.g. title) may not be.
