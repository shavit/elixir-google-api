defmodule GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.Lifecycle do
  @moduledoc """
  Lifecycle describes actions that the management system should take in
  response to container lifecycle events. For the PostStart and PreStop
  lifecycle handlers, management of the container blocks until the action is
  complete, unless the container process fails, in which case the handler is
  aborted.

  ## Attributes

  *   `postStart` (*type:* `GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.Handler.t`, *default:* `nil`) - PostStart is called immediately after a container is created. If the
      handler fails, the container is terminated and restarted according to its
      restart policy. Other management of the container blocks until the hook
      completes. More info:
      https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks
      +optional
  *   `preStop` (*type:* `GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.Handler.t`, *default:* `nil`) - PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated.
      The container is terminated after the handler completes.
      The reason for termination is passed to the handler.
      Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container is eventually
      terminated. Other management of the container blocks until the hook
      completes. More info:
      https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks
