  ## Attributes

  *   `configuration` (*type:* `GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.ConfigurationSpec.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The configuration for this service. All revisions from this service must
      come from a single configuration.
  *   `revisions` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Revisions is an ordered list of 1 or 2 revisions. The first is the current
      revision, and the second is the candidate revision. If a single revision
      is provided, traffic will be pinned at that revision.

      "@latest" is a shortcut for usage that refers to the latest created
      revision by the configuration.
  *   `rolloutPercent` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - RolloutPercent is the percent of traffic that should be sent to the
      candidate revision, i.e. the 2nd revision in the revisions list.
      Valid values are between 0 and 99 inclusive.
