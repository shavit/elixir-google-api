  ExecAction describes a "run in container" action.

  ## Attributes

  *   `command` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Command is the command line to execute inside the container, the working
      directory for the command  is root ('/') in the container's filesystem. The
      command is simply exec'd, it is not run inside a shell, so traditional
      shell instructions ('|', etc) won't work. To use a shell, you need to
      explicitly call out to that shell. Exit status of 0 is treated as
      live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy. +optional
