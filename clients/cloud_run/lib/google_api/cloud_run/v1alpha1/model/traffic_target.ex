defmodule GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.TrafficTarget do
  @moduledoc """
  TrafficTarget holds a single entry of the routing table for a Route.

  ## Attributes

  *   `configurationName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - ConfigurationName of a configuration to whose latest revision we will
      send this portion of traffic. When the "status.latestReadyRevisionName"
      of the referenced configuration changes, we will automatically migrate
      traffic from the prior "latest ready" revision to the new one. This field
      is never set in Route's status, only its spec. This is mutually exclusive
      with RevisionName.

      Cloud Run currently supports a single ConfigurationName.
  *   `latestRevision` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - LatestRevision may be optionally provided to indicate that the latest
      ready Revision of the Configuration should be used for this traffic
      target. When provided LatestRevision must be true if RevisionName is
      empty; it must be false when RevisionName is non-empty.
      +optional
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Name is optionally used to expose a dedicated hostname for referencing this
      target exclusively.

      Not currently supported by Cloud Run.
      +optional
  *   `percent` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Percent specifies percent of the traffic to this Revision or Configuration.
      This defaults to zero if unspecified.

      Cloud Run currently requires 100 percent for a single ConfigurationName
      TrafficTarget entry.
  *   `revisionName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - RevisionName of a specific revision to which to send this portion of
      traffic. This is mutually exclusive with ConfigurationName.

      Providing RevisionName in spec is not currently supported by Cloud Run.
  *   `tag` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Tag is optionally used to expose a dedicated url for referencing
      this target exclusively.

      Not currently supported in Cloud Run.
      +optional
  *   `url` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. URL displays the URL for accessing named traffic targets. URL
      is displayed in status, and is disallowed on spec. URL must contain a
      scheme (e.g. http://) and a hostname, but may not contain anything else
      (e.g. basic auth, url path, etc.

      Not currently supported in Cloud Run.
