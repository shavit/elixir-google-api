defmodule GoogleApi.Speech.V1.Model.SpeechContext do
  @moduledoc """
  Provides "hints" to the speech recognizer to favor specific words and phrases
  in the results.

  ## Attributes

  *   `phrases` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of strings containing words and phrases "hints" so that
      the speech recognition is more likely to recognize them. This can be used
      to improve the accuracy for specific words and phrases, for example, if
      specific commands are typically spoken by the user. This can also be used
      to add additional words to the vocabulary of the recognizer. See
      [usage limits](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/quotas#content).

      List items can also be set to classes for groups of words that represent
      common concepts that occur in natural language. For example, rather than
      providing phrase hints for every month of the year, using the $MONTH class
      improves the likelihood of correctly transcribing audio that includes
      months.
