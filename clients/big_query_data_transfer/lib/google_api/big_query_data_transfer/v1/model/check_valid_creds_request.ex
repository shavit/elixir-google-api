defmodule GoogleApi.BigQueryDataTransfer.V1.Model.CheckValidCredsRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  A request to determine whether the user has valid credentials. This method
  is used to limit the number of OAuth popups in the user interface. The
  user id is inferred from the API call context.
  If the data source has the Google+ authorization type, this method
  returns false, as it cannot be determined whether the credentials are
  already valid merely based on the user id.
