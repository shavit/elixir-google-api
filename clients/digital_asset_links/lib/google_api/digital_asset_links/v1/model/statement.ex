defmodule GoogleApi.DigitalAssetLinks.V1.Model.Statement do
  @moduledoc """
  Describes a reliable statement that has been made about the relationship
  between a source asset and a target asset.

  Statements are always made by the source asset, either directly or by
  delegating to a statement list that is stored elsewhere.

  For more detailed definitions of statements and assets, please refer
  to our [API documentation landing
  page](/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started).

  ## Attributes

  *   `relation` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The relation identifies the use of the statement as intended by the source
      asset's owner (that is, the person or entity who issued the statement).
      Every complete statement has a relation.

      We identify relations with strings of the format `<kind>/<detail>`, where
      `<kind>` must be one of a set of pre-defined purpose categories, and
      `<detail>` is a free-form lowercase alphanumeric string that describes the
      specific use case of the statement.

      Refer to [our API documentation](/digital-asset-links/v1/relation-strings)
      for the current list of supported relations.

      Example: `delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls`
      REQUIRED
  *   `source` (*type:* `GoogleApi.DigitalAssetLinks.V1.Model.Asset.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Every statement has a source asset.
      REQUIRED
  *   `target` (*type:* `GoogleApi.DigitalAssetLinks.V1.Model.Asset.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Every statement has a target asset.
