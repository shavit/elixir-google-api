defmodule GoogleApi.Drive.V3.Model.TeamDriveBackgroundImageFile do
  @moduledoc """
  An image file and cropping parameters from which a background image for this Team Drive is set. This is a write only field; it can only be set on drive.teamdrives.update requests that don't set themeId. When specified, all fields of the backgroundImageFile must be set.

  ## Attributes

  *   `id` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The ID of an image file in Drive to use for the background image.
  *   `width` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The width of the cropped image in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the width of the cropped image divided by the width of the entire image. The height is computed by applying a width to height aspect ratio of 80 to 9. The resulting image must be at least 1280 pixels wide and 144 pixels high.
  *   `xCoordinate` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The X coordinate of the upper left corner of the cropping area in the background image. This is a value in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the horizontal distance from the left side of the entire image to the left side of the cropping area divided by the width of the entire image.
  *   `yCoordinate` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The Y coordinate of the upper left corner of the cropping area in the background image. This is a value in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the vertical distance from the top side of the entire image to the top side of the cropping area divided by the height of the entire image.
