  The file content to which the comment refers, typically within the anchor region. For a text file, for example, this would be the text at the location of the comment.

  ## Attributes

  *   `mimeType` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The MIME type of the quoted content.
  *   `value` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The quoted content itself. This is interpreted as plain text if set through the API.
