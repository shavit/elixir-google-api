defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.Billing do
  @moduledoc """
  Billing related configuration of the service.

  The following example shows how to configure monitored resources and metrics
  for billing:

      monitored_resources:
      - type: library.googleapis.com/branch
        labels:
        - key: /city
          description: The city where the library branch is located in.
        - key: /name
          description: The name of the branch.
      metrics:
      - name: library.googleapis.com/book/borrowed_count
        metric_kind: DELTA
        value_type: INT64
      billing:
        consumer_destinations:
        - monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/branch
          metrics:
          - library.googleapis.com/book/borrowed_count

  ## Attributes

  *   `consumerDestinations` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.BillingDestination.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Billing configurations for sending metrics to the consumer project.
      There can be multiple consumer destinations per service, each one must have
      a different monitored resource type. A metric can be used in at most
      one consumer destination.
