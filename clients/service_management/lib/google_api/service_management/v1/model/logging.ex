  Logging configuration of the service.

  The following example shows how to configure logs to be sent to the
  producer and consumer projects. In the example, the `activity_history`
  log is sent to both the producer and consumer projects, whereas the
  `purchase_history` log is only sent to the producer project.

      monitored_resources:
      - type: library.googleapis.com/branch
        labels:
        - key: /city
          description: The city where the library branch is located in.
        - key: /name
          description: The name of the branch.
      logs:
      - name: activity_history
        labels:
        - key: /customer_id
      - name: purchase_history
      logging:
        producer_destinations:
        - monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/branch
          logs:
          - activity_history
          - purchase_history
        consumer_destinations:
        - monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/branch
          logs:
          - activity_history

  ## Attributes

  *   `consumerDestinations` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.LoggingDestination.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Logging configurations for sending logs to the consumer project.
      There can be multiple consumer destinations, each one must have a
      different monitored resource type. A log can be used in at most
      one consumer destination.
  *   `producerDestinations` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.LoggingDestination.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Logging configurations for sending logs to the producer project.
      There can be multiple producer destinations, each one must have a
      different monitored resource type. A log can be used in at most
      one producer destination.
