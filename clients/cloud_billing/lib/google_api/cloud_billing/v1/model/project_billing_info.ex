defmodule GoogleApi.CloudBilling.V1.Model.ProjectBillingInfo do
  @moduledoc """
  Encapsulation of billing information for a GCP Console project. A project
  has at most one associated billing account at a time (but a billing account
  can be assigned to multiple projects).

  ## Attributes

  *   `billingAccountName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The resource name of the billing account associated with the project, if
      any. For example, `billingAccounts/012345-567890-ABCDEF`.
  *   `billingEnabled` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - True if the project is associated with an open billing account, to which
      usage on the project is charged. False if the project is associated with a
      closed billing account, or no billing account at all, and therefore cannot
      use paid services. This field is read-only.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The resource name for the `ProjectBillingInfo`; has the form
      `projects/{project_id}/billingInfo`. For example, the resource name for the
      billing information for project `tokyo-rain-123` would be
      `projects/tokyo-rain-123/billingInfo`. This field is read-only.
  *   `projectId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The ID of the project that this `ProjectBillingInfo` represents, such as
      `tokyo-rain-123`. This is a convenience field so that you don't need to
      parse the `name` field to obtain a project ID. This field is read-only.
