  Write a Data Access (Gin) log

  ## Attributes

  *   `logMode` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether Gin logging should happen in a fail-closed manner at the caller. This is relevant only in the LocalIAM implementation, for now.

      NOTE: Logging to Gin in a fail-closed manner is currently unsupported while work is being done to satisfy the requirements of go/345. Currently, setting LOG_FAIL_CLOSED mode will have no effect, but still exists because there is active work being done to support it (b/115874152).
