defmodule GoogleApi.StorageTransfer.V1.Model.HttpData do
  @moduledoc """
  An HttpData resource specifies a list of objects on the web to be transferred
  over HTTP.  The information of the objects to be transferred is contained in
  a file referenced by a URL. The first line in the file must be
  "TsvHttpData-1.0", which specifies the format of the file.  Subsequent lines
  specify the information of the list of objects, one object per list entry.
  Each entry has the following tab-delimited fields:

  * HTTP URL - The location of the object.

  * Length - The size of the object in bytes.

  * MD5 - The base64-encoded MD5 hash of the object.

  For an example of a valid TSV file, see
  [Transferring data from
  URLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/transfer/create-url-list).

  When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in mind:

  * When an object located at `http(s)://hostname:port/<URL-path>` is
  transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data sink is
  `<hostname>/<URL-path>`.

  * If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size of the
  object fetched, the object will not be transferred.

  * If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the transferred
  bytes, the object transfer will fail. For more information, see
  [Generating MD5 hashes](https://cloud.google.com/storage/transfer/#md5)

  * Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For
  example, in Cloud Storage you can
  [share an object publicly]
  (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get
  a link to it.

  * Storage Transfer Service obeys `robots.txt` rules and requires the source
  HTTP server to support `Range` requests and to return a `Content-Length`
  header in each response.

  * [ObjectConditions](#ObjectConditions) have no effect when filtering objects
  to transfer.

  ## Attributes

  *   `listUrl` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The URL that points to the file that stores the object list
      entries. This file must allow public access.  Currently, only URLs with
      HTTP and HTTPS schemes are supported.
