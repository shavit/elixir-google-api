defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.ResourceCommitment do
  @moduledoc """
  Commitment for a particular resource (a Commitment is composed of one or more of these).

  ## Attributes

  *   `acceleratorType` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Name of the accelerator type resource. Applicable only when the type is ACCELERATOR.
  *   `amount` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The amount of the resource purchased (in a type-dependent unit, such as bytes). For vCPUs, this can just be an integer. For memory, this must be provided in MB. Memory must be a multiple of 256 MB, with up to 6.5GB of memory per every vCPU.
  *   `type` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Type of resource for which this commitment applies. Possible values are VCPU and MEMORY
