  Flags the specified instances to be removed from the managed instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces the targetSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked as DONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the status of the abandoning action with the listmanagedinstances method.

  If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

  You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

  ## Parameters

  *   `connection` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Connection.t`) - Connection to server
  *   `project` (*type:* `String.t`) - Project ID for this request.
  *   `zone` (*type:* `String.t`) - The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located.
  *   `instance_group_manager` (*type:* `String.t`) - The name of the managed instance group.
  *   `optional_params` (*type:* `keyword()`) - Optional parameters
      *   `:alt` (*type:* `String.t`) - Data format for the response.
      *   `:fields` (*type:* `String.t`) - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
      *   `:key` (*type:* `String.t`) - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
      *   `:oauth_token` (*type:* `String.t`) - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
      *   `:prettyPrint` (*type:* `boolean()`) - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
      *   `:quotaUser` (*type:* `String.t`) - An opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes. Must not exceed 40 characters.
      *   `:userIp` (*type:* `String.t`) - Deprecated. Please use quotaUser instead.
      *   `:requestId` (*type:* `String.t`) - An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

          For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

          The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  Retrieves the list of managed instance groups and groups them by zone.

  ## Parameters

  *   `connection` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Connection.t`) - Connection to server
  *   `project` (*type:* `String.t`) - Project ID for this request.
  *   `optional_params` (*type:* `keyword()`) - Optional parameters
      *   `:alt` (*type:* `String.t`) - Data format for the response.
      *   `:fields` (*type:* `String.t`) - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
      *   `:key` (*type:* `String.t`) - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
      *   `:oauth_token` (*type:* `String.t`) - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
      *   `:prettyPrint` (*type:* `boolean()`) - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
      *   `:quotaUser` (*type:* `String.t`) - An opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes. Must not exceed 40 characters.
      *   `:userIp` (*type:* `String.t`) - Deprecated. Please use quotaUser instead.
      *   `:filter` (*type:* `String.t`) - A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

          For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

          You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

          To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
      *   `:maxResults` (*type:* `integer()`) - The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
      *   `:orderBy` (*type:* `String.t`) - Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

          You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

          Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
      *   `:pageToken` (*type:* `String.t`) - Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  *   `opts` (*type:* `keyword()`) - Call options

  Retrieves a list of managed instance groups that are contained within the specified project and zone.

  ## Parameters

  *   `connection` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Connection.t`) - Connection to server
  *   `project` (*type:* `String.t`) - Project ID for this request.
  *   `zone` (*type:* `String.t`) - The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located.
  *   `optional_params` (*type:* `keyword()`) - Optional parameters
      *   `:alt` (*type:* `String.t`) - Data format for the response.
      *   `:fields` (*type:* `String.t`) - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
      *   `:key` (*type:* `String.t`) - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
      *   `:oauth_token` (*type:* `String.t`) - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
      *   `:prettyPrint` (*type:* `boolean()`) - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
      *   `:quotaUser` (*type:* `String.t`) - An opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes. Must not exceed 40 characters.
      *   `:userIp` (*type:* `String.t`) - Deprecated. Please use quotaUser instead.
      *   `:filter` (*type:* `String.t`) - A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

          For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

          You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

          To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
      *   `:maxResults` (*type:* `integer()`) - The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
      *   `:orderBy` (*type:* `String.t`) - Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

          You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

          Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
      *   `:pageToken` (*type:* `String.t`) - Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  *   `opts` (*type:* `keyword()`) - Call options

  ## Returns

  *   `{:ok, %GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.InstanceGroupManagerList{}}` on success
  *   `{:error, info}` on failure

  Resizes the managed instance group. If you increase the size, the group creates new instances using the current instance template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes instances. The resize operation is marked DONE when the resize actions are scheduled even if the group has not yet added or deleted any instances. You must separately verify the status of the creating or deleting actions with the listmanagedinstances method.

  When resizing down, the instance group arbitrarily chooses the order in which VMs are deleted. The group takes into account some VM attributes when making the selection including:

  + The status of the VM instance. + The health of the VM instance. + The instance template version the VM is based on. + For regional managed instance groups, the location of the VM instance.

  This list is subject to change.

  If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

  Specifies the instance template to use when creating new instances in this group. The templates for existing instances in the group do not change unless you recreate them.

  ## Parameters

  *   `connection` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Connection.t`) - Connection to server
  *   `project` (*type:* `String.t`) - Project ID for this request.
  *   `zone` (*type:* `String.t`) - The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located.
  *   `instance_group_manager` (*type:* `String.t`) - The name of the managed instance group.
  *   `optional_params` (*type:* `keyword()`) - Optional parameters
      *   `:alt` (*type:* `String.t`) - Data format for the response.
      *   `:fields` (*type:* `String.t`) - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
      *   `:key` (*type:* `String.t`) - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
      *   `:oauth_token` (*type:* `String.t`) - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
      *   `:prettyPrint` (*type:* `boolean()`) - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
      *   `:quotaUser` (*type:* `String.t`) - An opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes. Must not exceed 40 characters.
      *   `:userIp` (*type:* `String.t`) - Deprecated. Please use quotaUser instead.
      *   `:requestId` (*type:* `String.t`) - An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

          For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

          The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
