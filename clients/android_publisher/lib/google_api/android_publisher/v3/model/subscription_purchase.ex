      - Re-signup of a canceled but non-lapsed subscription 
      - Upgrade/downgrade from a previous subscription  For example, suppose a user originally signs up and you receive purchase token X, then the user cancels and goes through the resignup flow (before their subscription lapses) and you receive purchase token Y, and finally the user upgrades their subscription and you receive purchase token Z. If you call this API with purchase token Z, this field will be set to Y. If you call this API with purchase token Y, this field will be set to X. If you call this API with purchase token X, this field will not be set.

  *   `priceChange` (*type:* `GoogleApi.AndroidPublisher.V3.Model.SubscriptionPriceChange.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The latest price change information available. This is present only when there is an upcoming price change for the subscription yet to be applied.
