defmodule GoogleApi.AppEngine.V1.Model.BasicScaling do
  @moduledoc """
  A service with basic scaling will create an instance when the application receives a request. The instance will be turned down when the app becomes idle. Basic scaling is ideal for work that is intermittent or driven by user activity.

  ## Attributes

  *   `idleTimeout` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Duration of time after the last request that an instance must wait before the instance is shut down.
  *   `maxInstances` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Maximum number of instances to create for this version.
